## Reflections

I learnt a ton from this challenge, from new tools such as Email Analysis and Forensics, string analysis and signature detection with YARA and Splunk, which I do need more practice on. Detecting and Analysing IoCs were very fun and I sincerely want to thank [@RangeForce](https://github.com/RangeForce) for putting this together!
