Each Level consists of different missions that may or may not be related to each other. Each containing folder consists of `dependencies`, which are artifacts, IoCs, wordlist, analysis ouput from the challenges, which are meant to aid your understanding of these challenges and `images of <x>` folder, where `<x>` is the shorthand for the Level CodeName (Email, Yara and Splunk), which are used as a visual aid in the markdown writeup files. Do open an [issue](https://github.com/RyanNgCT/RangeForce-SOC-Chall/issues) if you spot any errors or typos.

Here's proof that I completed all the levels and my badge awarded by RangeForce!

## Reflections

I learnt a ton from this challenge, from new tools such as Email Analysis and Forensics, string analysis and signature detection with YARA and Splunk, which I do need more practice on. Detecting and Analysing IoCs were very fun and I sincerely want to thank [@RangeForce](https://github.com/RangeForce) for putting this together!
